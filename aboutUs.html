                <h1> Why are we doing this?</h1>
                <span>Over the past 30 years, petroleum geologists has gone from field-based science to 2D, and to 3D simulation. However, when they map oil reservoir, having the plan 
                    for drilling and production, they face with a lot of uncertainties. With a limited data, a single presentation of one oil field will have high probability of being 
                    inaccurate. History has shown there are oil fields which have billions of dollars invested but operating at only few percentages of the capacity. Indeed, with the 
                    current geological workflow, it is very easy for billions of dollars investment to go wasted. </span>

                <h1> What do we do?</h1>
                <span>That is why we come up with Petro GeoTech, the AI geological data analysis software system. The system will extract the trends of complicated geological datasets, 
                    build millions of reservoir scenarios in a short period of time, so that companies can make economic decisions along a reservoir life cycle. So instead of having a 
                    single presentation, our system will give geologists range of scenarios, and test whether that range is efficient enough to move forward, strongly supporting the 
                    investment decision of the company. Furthermore, the software will keep updating and automatically learning from all of the past projects of experienced geologists 
                    to improve its own intelligence, to produce better simulations in the future.</span>

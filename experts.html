            <h3> Meet <p class="name" style="color: blue;"> Perla Woo</p></h3>
            <span>Over the past 30 years, petroleum geologists has gone from field-based science to 2D, and to 3D simulation. However, when they map oil reservoir, having the plan 
                for drilling and production, they face with a lot of uncertainties. With a limited data, a single presentation of one oil field will have high probability of being 
                inaccurate. History has shown there are oil fields which have billions of dollars invested but operating at only few percentages of the capacity. Indeed, with the 
                current geological workflow, it is very easy for billions of dollars investment to go wasted. </span>
